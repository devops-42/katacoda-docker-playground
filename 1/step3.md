Now we run our first Docker container. The command used is `docker run`. The first example is very simple and well-known: "Hello World":

`docker run hello-world`{{execute}}

The container starts, prints a message and exits.

Note, that the `run` command checks automatically whether the image to run has been pulled already. In our case we did not pull the images `hello-world` yet, so an image pull will be triggered.

As suggested in the output of the "Hello, World" example we try a more ambitious example. Back to our Nginx image pulled in the steps before we want to start a container from the `latest` Nginx image:

`docker run nginx`{{execute}}

It seems that nothing happens, no output at all. Abort the `run` command by hitting <kbd>‚åÉCTRL</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd> 

What happened? The Docker daemon created a container base on the parameter we specified in the `docker run` command. We only specified the image name, thus the container has been started in foreground (default behaviour).

To start the container in `detached` mode add the flag `-d`:

`docker run -d nginx`{{execute}}

We can verify that the container had been started with the `docker ps` command:

`docker ps`{{execute}}

This command gives status information about running containers, such as:
- CONTAINER ID: A unique container id (generated)
- IMAGE: Image name (and tag)
- COMMAND: Started process in container (we'll cover this later)
- CREATED: When created
- STATUS: Current status
- PORTS: Exposed ports (we'll cover this in the next exercise)
- NAMES: Generated alias name (we'll cover this in the next exercise)

The container can be stopped by the following command:

`docker stop <CONTAINER ID>`

which is for our example:

`docker stop $(docker ps | grep nginx | awk '{print $1}')`{{execute}}`

Our Nginx container is stopped, so we need to use the `-a` (all) flag to include stopped container in the output:

`docker ps -a`{{execute}}

Note the `Exited` status.
